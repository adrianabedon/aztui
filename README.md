# Banjo AzTUI
[![Go](https://github.com/brendank310/aztui/actions/workflows/go.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/brendank310/aztui/actions/workflows/go.yml)

A work in progress text user interface for controlling your Azure resources. Code is currently a mess, but the plan is clean it up and add functionality as time goes on.

# Instructions

Install the azcli and login using `az cli`. Once logged in you can build and run banjo with:
`make all && bin\banjo`

# Demo

# Notice

I do work for Microsoft on Azure, but this is a personal project done in my spare time as a tool for my convenience (I hope this is a bit more responsive than the web portal), as well as learning the tview library for other personal projects related to the [beepy device](https://beepy.sqfmi.com/).
